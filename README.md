### A basic boilerplate for React
`git clone https://github.com/ThinkingJoules/react_gundb-time-app.git`
`npm install --save`

For the server credentials
```
//credentials.js
//top level file

exports.creds = {
	"username": "admin",
	"password": "your_password_here",
	"pubKey": "this is console.logged on the server, I don't thin it needs this in the creds file to work"
}

```

`npm start`
